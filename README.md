#### The glorified beekeeper
This is my project for learning Go! It runs on Linux. To start the web server with this source code, run `npm run go` and to quit, hit `ctrl + c` (or close your terminal) and run `make clean`.

## The Goal
This is a web app that will host a UI for a neural network for estimating the result of the sin function using particle swarm optimization. This gives an easy way of seeing the different effects that swarm parameters can have on a neural network. The focus for this project will be in creating a dynamic web page with Go and creating a mathematically heavy project. This will be based off a C++ project I've previously made:

## Hosting
When this app is ready for production I will either host it on [isoptera](https://isoptera.lcsc.edu/~cshumaker) or on a personal domain.
