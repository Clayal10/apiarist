# Neural Network
This will be a neural network that will estimate the output value of whatever input is given from the user. For now we will start with the Sine function.

> Warning: The outputs will not be 100% accurate. This is a very very small neural network in comparison to others found online

## Algorithm
This will be a neural network that utalizes [Particle Swarm Optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_swarm_optimization) to prevent local minima that the networks can get trapped in.
