# Neural Network
This will be a neural network that will estimate the output value of whatever input is given from the user. For now we will start with the Sine function.
I would like to put this in a /pkg directory some day but probably not.

> Warning: The outputs will not be 100% accurate. This is a very very small neural network in comparison to others found online
